# NetworkResetTool

A very simple console application target at .Net Framework 4.5.

Originally for students who are tired of manually resetting DHCP to connect to PLC and other lower-tier devices.

So I wrote this small program to simplify this action, allowing it to be executed quickly just by placing it on the desktop.

# Install or Compile

Theoretically, the release can run on Windows 7 and later systems, because .Net Framework 4.5 is included with the operating system.

Just build it with VS 2010+.
